It is an website providing services pertaining to Mental Health and well being.

The website caters to all students, but the website seems to be mostly help International students who have moved from a different country and will be hustling to adjust to the new culture.
**3. Do you believe they reach their audience?**
I believe the website does reach out to the audience, but it is solely dependent on the student to opt for help. So, if someone doesnot explore the website might not get to know the services that are being offered.

The website is meant for anyone who has legal ability to work in Canada and is looking forward to seek employment at the organization.

I don't find Mcdonalds promoting their recruitement website as much as they promote their product. The organization still takes recruitement at franchise level. 
**4. Was this site useful to you? Why or why not?**
Unfortunately, I did not find the website very suitable as the workflow is created in such a way that one doesnot have to login or register. That might be a convinience but also cannot accomodate a way to track the job applications. Thus the applicant still has to depend on receiving a call from the Hiring Manger.
**5. List one interesting fact or issue that this site addressed.**
On taking the mouse pointer to the Sandwitch menu icon, the animation is brilliant. Also the color combination is indicative of the historical Mcdonalds brand color.

No, I wouldnot. As the website doesnot allow the applicant to track the applications.

Allowing users to register would help applicants me more aware of the status of their applications.
